Comparison of Linear Search and Binary Search Algorithms

Linear Search:

Linear search iterates through each element in the dataset sequentially until it finds the target element or reaches the end of the dataset.
It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the dataset.
Linear search is suitable for unsorted datasets or when the dataset size is small.
It does not require the dataset to be sorted.

Binary Search:

Binary search is a divide and conquer algorithm that requires the dataset to be sorted beforehand.
It compares the target element with the middle element of the dataset and eliminates half of the dataset based on the comparison.
It has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the dataset.
Binary search is significantly faster than linear search for large datasets because it reduces the search space exponentially with each iteration.
