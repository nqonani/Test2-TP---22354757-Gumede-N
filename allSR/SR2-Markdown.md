Data Types in Machine Learning

In the context of machine learning, different data types serve distinct purposes:

- Categorical Data: For instance, the column `ward_councillor` is categorical, representing different categories or groups.
  Categorical data is often used in classification models and can be encoded into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.

- Numerical Data: The column `density_dwellings` is numerical and continuous, representing the density of dwellings.
  Numerical data is crucial for regression models and as input features in various machine learning algorithms.

Proper handling and preprocessing of these data types are vital for building effective machine learning models.
